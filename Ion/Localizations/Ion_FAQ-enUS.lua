L.FAQ_BAR_CONFIGURE_BAR_STATES_TITLE = "Bar States"

L.FAQ_BAR_CONFIGURE_BAR_STATES = [[|cffffd200Bar States Selector|r
The Bar States options allows for custom states and visibility triggers to be added to a bar.  A bar state is what items are currently shown on it. Adding additional states will allow you to automatically change what is displayed when a set state is triggered.  The default state is called the home state.

|cffffd200Preset Action States|r
|cffffd200Paged:|r  When this is selected you can set 6 different pages of buttons.  The ability to switch between the pages is via the game's key binding settings.  The settings are Next & Previous Action Bar found under the Action Bar section.
|cffffd200Stance:|r  This option is only available if a character has different stances available.  When selected, switching stances will change the displayed buttons.
|cffffd200Pet:|r  When this is selected you can have the bar change whenever a character gains control of a pet.

|cffffd200Custom Action States|r
Ion allows you to create your own custom bar states.  This is done by entering the desired state conditions, separated by a semicolon.  If you enter an improperly formatted state, an error message will be displayed in the chat window. It is advised not to use any Preset Action States when using custom states.  Custom Actions state can be formed by using the majority of the default game macro conditionals, with "no" being added to the front of the conditional to check for a false state.  IE [nocombat]

Example:  [actionbar:1];[stance:1];[stance3,stealth];[mounted]

|cffffd200Bar Visibility Toggles|r
These options allow you to customize when a bar should be displayed or hidden.  If a selection has a green mark next to it, then the bar will be shown when that condition is met.  By unselecting the option, the bar will be hidden if the condition is met.]]



L.FAQ_BAR_CONFIGURE_SPELL_TARGET_TITLE = "Spell Target Options"
L.FAQ_BAR_CONFIGURE_SPELL_TARGET = [[Spell target options allow you to automatically add certain cast modifiers to spells added to the bar.  Only spells dragged to the bar from the spell book will have these modifiers added.  A way to check to see if a spell will be affected is to look at the button using the macro editor.  If the macro has "#autowrite" at the beginning, then it can use the targeting options. 

|cffffd200Self-Cast by Modifier:|r  When enabled, any spell cast while holding the selected modifier key will try to be cast on your character. Note the selected modifier for this setting is global and will be the same for every bar.  Changing it on one bar will change it for all.

|cffffd200Focus-Cast by modifier:|r  When enabled, any spell cast while holding the selected modifier key will try to be cast on your character's focus target. Note the selected modifier for this setting is global and will be the same for every bar.  Changing it on one bar will change it for all.

|cffffd200Mouse-Over Casting:|r  When enabled, any spell cast while holding the selected modifier key will try to be cast on the mob that the mouse cursor is currently over.  If the modifier for this option is set to "None" then it will always be on.]]
